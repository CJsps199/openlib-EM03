# openlib-EM03
3 phase Energy meter built on openlib

Software not supported or warranted. 

Built onto the Emon Openlib single phase energy meter library.

Looking to still integrate the MQTT Server Selection on the Autoconnect library. (When I get the inspiration to sit and figure it out) 

Future plans are to integrate Peak Power Demand Shaving to the system.

Extra Features:

3 Phase power/energy meter, 3 current sensor inputs and 3 voltage inputs (currently).
Measures Killowatt Hours per phase (kWh).
Measures Peak Power draw per phase.
Max resolution: 
Can only manage to send data every 2 seconds. Any interval higher will work. 


Utilization of the ESP32 Microcontroller
250/1 CT's
230V-9V Transformers
Raspberry Pi Server hosting : Grafana, Influxdb, Node-red & Zerotier. (Or works better with cloud server for remote access with ease)

To Be Finished for current project:
